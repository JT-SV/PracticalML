## Readme

This repo contains the outcome of my Course Project analysis.  Only the html version is provided since the assignment states:

"Due to security concerns with the exchange of R code, your code will not be run during the evaluation by your classmates. Please be sure that if they download the repo, they will be able to view the compiled HTML version of your analysis."

A .pdf file is also provided since opening the .html in GitHub does not display its contents correctly.
